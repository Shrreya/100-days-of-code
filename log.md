# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Updated my portfolio website and an Android app tutorial I had created about a month back.

**Thoughts**: I think it's very important to keep your project repos maintained as that creates a sense of ownership and accountability.

### Day 2: March 7, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Updated the UI and did some code refactoring on an old Android Project - Instagram Banner.

**Thoughts**: Going back to previous projects pushes you to work on updating deprecated APIs.

### Day 3: March 8, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Setup a project from my last year's research in Android + BLE. Planning to keep improving on it and build some libraries on top. Also, speaking of research, the [developer preview for Android P](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/previewing-android-p.html) was launched yesterday. Excited to take that up ahead in my #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts**: Research is a never ending process.

## Rebooting 100 Days Of Code

Life got in the way, and I couldn't sustain the challenge. However, I don't wish to give up. Hence, this is my second attempt at the challenge. Better late than never!

### Day 1: July 1, 2018 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Participated in a coding challenge on HackerEarth. Built an Android app to search & browse crafted beers. I took 3 hours in the timed challenge.

**Thoughts**: Learned that Glide can help in working with GIFs in Android. Also, it was fun to tinker around with RecyclerView after a long time. Felt happy that I haven't forgotten my Java and Android skills.

### Day 2: July 5, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Built a new feature for the BeerCraft app to sort the list of beers by name and alcoholic content.

**Thoughts**: Learned how to use lambda expressions with Java 8 for Android. This is a good way to reduce boilerplate code. Since I have been writing more Javascript & ES6 recently, it felt good to lose this pain in Java.

### Day 3: July 9, 2018 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed bugs and completed the sorting feature of the BeerCraft app.

**Thoughts**: Was stuck with the default sort option for a long time, it was a good revision of Java's reference assignment of objects/variables. Meanwhile, I received the news from HackerEarth that I've been shortlisted in the coding challenge. This has been a major confidence booster for me. Small wins matter!

### Day 4: July 10, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a new project in the React Nanodegree Program by Udacity. A web app to play the "Would You Rather?" game. Using React & Redux.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit jittery about this project. It needs to be well planned and architected. Must grasp React + Redux concepts well. Aiming to finish the project by the weekend.

### Day 5: July 12, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Set up first actions, reducers & middleware for the Would You Rather project. Worked on the login screen with Material UI.

**Thoughts**: I struggle with creating views for the web while I'm much more comfortable doing the same for mobile apps. So, I guess that means this is an area I must practice more on.

### Day 6: July 13, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the login page and started working on the home page. Made choices between where to use material UI and where to use good old raw CSS.

**Thoughts**: Realised that overriding default CSS in Material UI is not always straightforward and can actually be a bottleneck in the coding process. Must spend time researching on good UI libraries. Nevertheless, I enjoy design.

### Day 7: July 14, 2018 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through building the dashboard screen now. Taking a steady approach by tinkering with Material UI components in CodePen before implementing in project. Also, building static components first to fix the design and then populating content from the store.

**Thoughts**: I'm finally getting productive again but not as much as I can be. Must improve my pace of coding, must set more deadlines for self.

### Day 8: July 15, 2018 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't code much today except for some CSS changes and upgrading one of the React components.

**Thoughts**: I've made 40+ commits in the last week since rebooting the challenge and this is huge progress from where I was the last time. Also, I gave up on day 8 last time and that shall not happen again this time.

### Day 9: July 17, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on new components, spent some time with design. Also, identified some bugs that need fixing.

**Thoughts**: Took a day off and have ended up slowing down further. I have two hackathons lined up at the end of this week, so I must finish this project by Thursday. Not sure, if it is possible.

### Day 10: July 18, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a major feature, that is, answering of questions. However, lots of bugs yet to be fixed in order to make the app foolproof.

**Thoughts**: I am understanding Redux much better now, having written a complex reducer function today. mapStateToProps is my new favourite concept, now that I've actually leveraged its power in one of the components. Time management is still an issue that needs to be improved upon.

### Day 11: July 19, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored the login logic and data fetch logic in my project. More bugs to fix regarding data persistence & routing.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling much more confident about my Javascript and frontend skills these days. This is something I've struggled with a lot in the past. Now I realise it was only my own fear holding me back. I always knew I'm a polyglot developer and can pick up any new programming language or framework. I'm thinking about the Node.js masterclass, coding without any packages, frameworks or dependencies.

### Day 12: July 24, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Resumed work on the Udacity project today.

**Thoughts**: I gave up on the hackathons that I thought I would take up during the weekend because I did not feel ready. I feel now I am taking too long to finish the Udacity project. This calls for fixing my routine & time management to fit more hours in the day for coding.

### Day 13: July 25, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all the pages of the Would You Rather app. Final bug fixes left now.

**Thoughts**: What a productive day! 14 commits. And finally the app works from start to end. Feeling accomplished.

### Day 14: July 28, 2018 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started with a pre-work assignment for a job application. This is a web app to create & discover volunteering opportunities. Set up the backend today using Parse server.

**Thoughts**: It was good to write some Node.js & revise my DevOps knowledge. I feel more confident of competitive coding & hiring challenges these days.

### Day 15: July 29, 2018 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Spent first half of the day on the frontend of the TFI volunteer app. Later in the evening, participated in another coding challenge on HackerEarth. Built a full stack web app for listing different types of wines.

**Thoughts**: This weekend was a complete MERN stack marathon! And I think I aced it.

### Day 16: July 30, 2018 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed all frontend code for the pre-work assignment. Ready to submit it first thing tomorrow morning. Hope I get the job!

**Thoughts**: It feels incredible to complete a full stack application from start to end.

### Day 17: August 6, 2018 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Resumed my Udacity project. Completed all high level TODOs.

**Thoughts**: After a highly productive set of days, I gave into emotional distress again and stopped coding for a while. This sucks! I think I should have at least one continuous streak of 10 days in the challenge.

### Day 18: August 7, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finally! Submitted the Udacity project. Also, gave a daunting technical interview today.

**Thoughts**: I have immensely enjoyed working on this Udacity project. 85 code commits. I gotta pat myself on the back. Now hoping I also get the job.

### Day 19: August 8, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Updated some old project repos.

**Thoughts**: Not only did I receive an amazing project review from Udacity but also heard back that I cleared yesterday's technical interview. Today has been a real day of acheivement after what feels like a very long long time.

### Day 20: August 10, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress & Thoughts**: Today calls for a celebration. I got the job! Technology Consultant at Teach For India.

### Day 21: August 16, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started the React Native lessons in the React Nanodegree. Set up expo & dev environments, learning by building a fitness tracking app.

**Thoughts**: Hoping to finish the final project in a week. Need to wrap up current state of projects in the next two weeks so that I am in a good place to start my new job in September. Ofcourse I will keep the challenge going till I complete 100 days.

### Day 22: August 17, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Built one complete screen of my first React Native app.

**Thoughts**: I have avoided React Native for a long time for no good reason. Feels good to finally get a grasp. It is enjoyable because fundamentally it is just Javascript & can leverage the company of Redux.

### Day 23: August 18, 2018 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started with styling and CSS in JS.

**Thoughts**: Struggling with headaches these days. It is affecting my concentration.
