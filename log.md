# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Updated my portfolio website and an Android app tutorial I had created about a month back.

**Thoughts**: I think it's very important to keep your project repos maintained as that creates a sense of ownership and accountability.

### Day 2: March 7, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Updated the UI and did some code refactoring on an old Android Project - Instagram Banner.

**Thoughts**: Going back to previous projects pushes you to work on updating deprecated APIs.

### Day 3: March 8, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Setup a project from my last year's research in Android + BLE. Planning to keep improving on it and build some libraries on top. Also, speaking of research, the [developer preview for Android P](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/previewing-android-p.html) was launched yesterday. Excited to take that up ahead in my #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts**: Research is a never ending process.

### Day 4: March 9, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Preparing to apply to the Outreachy internships for development in open source projects. This is something I always wanted to participate in since college, I hope to get selected this year.

**Thoughts**: Never give up on those pending dreams and aspirations. It's never too late.

### Day 5: March 12, 2018 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Began my first Kotlin development course. Worked on converting a note taking application written in Java to Kotlin.

**Thoughts**: Always feels good to learn new programming languages. And wow, such clean code!

### Day 6: March 13, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on yesterday's Kotlin project and completed it.

### Day 7: March 14, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Explored Open Data Kit and their projects. Made a contribution to the ODK Collect app.

### Day 8: March 23, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Getting back on track with some practice of design-minded development and performance optimisation.

**Thoughts**: Was once asked in a job interview to describe a performance optimisation situation. Always wanted to study Android performance since then. Glad to find these courses on Udacity.

## Rebooting 100 Days Of Code

Life got in the way, and I couldn't sustain the challenge. However, I don't wish to give up. Hence, this is my second attempt at the challenge. Better late than never!

### Day 1: July 1, 2018 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Participated in a coding challenge on HackerEarth. Built an Android app to search & browse crafted beers. I took 3 hours in the timed challenge.

**Thoughts**: Learned that Glide can help in working with GIFs in Android. Also, it was fun to tinker around with RecyclerView after a long time. Felt happy that I haven't forgotten my Java and Android skills.

### Day 2: July 5, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Built a new feature for the BeerCraft app to sort the list of beers by name and alcoholic content.

**Thoughts**: Learned how to use lambda expressions with Java 8 for Android. This is a good way to reduce boilerplate code. Since I have been writing more Javascript & ES6 recently, it felt good to lose this pain in Java.

### Day 3: July 9, 2018 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed bugs and completed the sorting feature of the BeerCraft app.

**Thoughts**: Was stuck with the default sort option for a long time, it was a good revision of Java's reference assignment of objects/variables. Meanwhile, I received the news from HackerEarth that I've been shortlisted in the coding challenge. This has been a major confidence booster for me. Small wins matter!

### Day 4: July 10, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a new project in the React Nanodegree Program by Udacity. A web app to play the "Would You Rather?" game. Using React & Redux.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit jittery about this project. It needs to be well planned and architected. Must grasp React + Redux concepts well. Aiming to finish the project by the weekend.

### Day 5: July 12, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Set up first actions, reducers & middleware for the Would You Rather project. Worked on the login screen with Material UI.

**Thoughts**: I struggle with creating views for the web while I'm much more comfortable doing the same for mobile apps. So, I guess that means this is an area I must practice more on.

### Day 6: July 13, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the login page and started working on the home page. Made choices between where to use material UI and where to use good old raw CSS.

**Thoughts**: Realised that overriding default CSS in Material UI is not always straightforward and can actually be a bottleneck in the coding process. Must spend time researching on good UI libraries. Nevertheless, I enjoy design.

### Day 7: July 14, 2018 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through building the dashboard screen now. Taking a steady approach by tinkering with Material UI components in CodePen before implementing in project. Also, building static components first to fix the design and then populating content from the store.

**Thoughts**: I'm finally getting productive again but not as much as I can be. Must improve my pace of coding, must set more deadlines for self.

### Day 8: July 15, 2018 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't code much today except for some CSS changes and upgrading one of the React components.

**Thoughts**: I've made 40+ commits in the last week since rebooting the challenge and this is huge progress from where I was the last time. Also, I gave up on day 8 last time and that shall not happen again this time.

### Day 9: July 17, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on new components, spent some time with design. Also, identified some bugs that need fixing.

**Thoughts**: Took a day off and have ended up slowing down further. I have two hackathons lined up at the end of this week, so I must finish this project by Thursday. Not sure, if it is possible.

### Day 10: July 18, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a major feature, that is, answering of questions. However, lots of bugs yet to be fixed in order to make the app foolproof.

**Thoughts**: I am understanding Redux much better now, having written a complex reducer function today. mapStateToProps is my new favourite concept, now that I've actually leveraged its power in one of the components. Time management is still an issue that needs to be improved upon.

### Day 11: July 19, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored the login logic and data fetch logic in my project. More bugs to fix regarding data persistence & routing.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling much more confident about my Javascript and frontend skills these days. This is something I've struggled with a lot in the past. Now I realise it was only my own fear holding me back. I always knew I'm a polyglot developer and can pick up any new programming language or framework. I'm thinking about the Node.js masterclass, coding without any packages, frameworks or dependencies.

### Day 12: July 24, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Resumed work on the Udacity project today.

**Thoughts**: I gave up on the hackathons that I thought I would take up during the weekend because I did not feel ready. I feel now I am taking too long to finish the Udacity project. This calls for fixing my routine & time management to fit more hours in the day for coding.

### Day 13: July 25, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all the pages of the Would You Rather app. Final bug fixes left now.

**Thoughts**: What a productive day! 14 commits. And finally the app works from start to end. Feeling accomplished.

### Day 14: July 28, 2018 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started with a pre-work assignment for a job application. This is a web app to create & discover volunteering opportunities. Set up the backend today using Parse server.

**Thoughts**: It was good to write some Node.js & revise my DevOps knowledge. I feel more confident of competitive coding & hiring challenges these days.
