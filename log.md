# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Updated my portfolio website and an Android app tutorial I had created about a month back.

**Thoughts**: I think it's very important to keep your project repos maintained as that creates a sense of ownership and accountability.

### Day 2: March 7, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Updated the UI and did some code refactoring on an old Android Project - Instagram Banner.

**Thoughts**: Going back to previous projects pushes you to work on updating deprecated APIs.

### Day 3: March 8, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Setup a project from my last year's research in Android + BLE. Planning to keep improving on it and build some libraries on top. Also, speaking of research, the [developer preview for Android P](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/previewing-android-p.html) was launched yesterday. Excited to take that up ahead in my #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts**: Research is a never ending process.

**Today's Progress**: Preparing to apply to the Outreachy internships for development in open source projects. This is something I always wanted to participate in since college, I hope to get selected this year.

**Thoughts**: Never give up on those pending dreams and aspirations. It's never too late.

### Day 7: March 14, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Explored Open Data Kit and their projects. Made a contribution to the ODK Collect app.

### Day 8: March 23, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Getting back on track with some practice of design-minded development and performance optimisation.

**Thoughts**: Was once asked in a job interview to describe a performance optimisation situation. Always wanted to study Android performance since then. Glad to find these courses on Udacity.

## Rebooting 100 Days Of Code

Life got in the way, and I couldn't sustain the challenge. However, I don't wish to give up. Hence, this is my second attempt at the challenge. Better late than never!

### Day 1: July 1, 2018 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Participated in a coding challenge on HackerEarth. Built an Android app to search & browse crafted beers. I took 3 hours in the timed challenge.

**Thoughts**: Learned that Glide can help in working with GIFs in Android. Also, it was fun to tinker around with RecyclerView after a long time. Felt happy that I haven't forgotten my Java and Android skills.

### Day 2: July 5, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Built a new feature for the BeerCraft app to sort the list of beers by name and alcoholic content.

**Thoughts**: Learned how to use lambda expressions with Java 8 for Android. This is a good way to reduce boilerplate code. Since I have been writing more Javascript & ES6 recently, it felt good to lose this pain in Java.

### Day 3: July 9, 2018 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed bugs and completed the sorting feature of the BeerCraft app.

**Thoughts**: Was stuck with the default sort option for a long time, it was a good revision of Java's reference assignment of objects/variables. Meanwhile, I received the news from HackerEarth that I've been shortlisted in the coding challenge. This has been a major confidence booster for me. Small wins matter!
