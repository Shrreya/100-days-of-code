# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Updated my portfolio website and an Android app tutorial I had created about a month back.

**Thoughts**: I think it's very important to keep your project repos maintained as that creates a sense of ownership and accountability.

### Day 2: March 7, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Updated the UI and did some code refactoring on an old Android Project - Instagram Banner.

**Thoughts**: Going back to previous projects pushes you to work on updating deprecated APIs.

### Day 3: March 8, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Setup a project from my last year's research in Android + BLE. Planning to keep improving on it and build some libraries on top. Also, speaking of research, the [developer preview for Android P](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/previewing-android-p.html) was launched yesterday. Excited to take that up ahead in my #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts**: Research is a never ending process.

### Day 4: March 9, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Preparing to apply to the Outreachy internships for development in open source projects. This is something I always wanted to participate in since college, I hope to get selected this year.

**Thoughts**: Never give up on those pending dreams and aspirations. It's never too late.
