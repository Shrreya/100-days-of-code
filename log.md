# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I updated my portfolio website and an Android app tutorial I had created about a month back.

**Thoughts** I think it's very important to keep your project repos maintained as that creates a sense of ownership and accountability.

### Day 2: March 7, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I updated the UI and did some code refactoring on an old Android Project - Instagram Banner.

**Thoughts** Going back to previous projects pushes you to work on updating deprecated APIs.
